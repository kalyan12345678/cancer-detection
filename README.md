Cancer Disease Detection is about diagnosing Breast Cancer (BC) disease through images of benign &amp; malignant disease. The early diagnosis of BC can improve the prognosis and chance of survival significantly, as it can promote timely clinical treatment to patients. Further accurate classification of benign tumors can prevent patients undergoing unnecessary treatments. Thus, the correct diagnosis of BC and classification of patients into malignant or benign groups is the subject of much research.  The Machine Learning model for this project is developed and implemented using densenet architecture in jupyternotebook using transfer learning where we got 91% accuracy.
